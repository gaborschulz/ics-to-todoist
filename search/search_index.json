This is great if you would like to collect a list of events as to-dos in Todoist. Requirements The tool needs Python >= 3.10 to run. It has been tested with Python 3.10 and 3.11. Installation The easiest way to install and use this package is through pipx . Make sure pipx is installed on your system. You can check this by running the pipx --version command. Once that's in place, you can install ics-to-todoist by running the following command in your terminal: pipx install ics-to-todoist Usage Step 1 You'll need to provide an API key to the tool to interact with Todoist. To do so, visit the Todoist Website Click on your initials in the upper right hand corner. Click on Integrations . In the pop-up, scroll down to the bottom to the sectin API token . Click on Copy to clipboard to copy your token Step 2 You can provide the token you generated in Step 1 to the tool in 2 ways: as an environment variable (preferred): create a new environment variable called TODOIST_API_KEY and set it to the value of the token you got in Step 1 . in the config file: you can use the config file to provide the api key. This is useful if you use multiple Todoist accounts. Just make sure to not share the config file with anybody you would not share your password with. Step 3 Create a config file for your upload. For more details, check out this section . Step 4 Run the tool like this: ics-to-todoist <ICS_FILE> --config-path <CONFIG_FILE> Replace <ICS_FILE> with the path of your .ics file and <CONFIG_FILE> with the path of your configuration file.

These are simple .toml files that have the following structure: relevant_names = \"ABC|DEF|GHI|JKL\" target_project = \"Inbox\" default_reminder = false timezone = \"Europe/Berlin\" todoist_api_key = \"123\" only_future_events = true [[reminder_times]] day_offset = -1 hour_offset = 18 [[reminder_times]] hour = 5 minute = 45 [[reminder_times]] hour = 6 minute = 0 Root The top section contains general settings. These are the following: relevant_names : this is a regular expression which will be used to select relevant events from the .ics file. This is only applied to the SUMMARY field in the .ics file. If this pattern appears anywhere in the name then the event will be added. target_project : this is a regular expression which will be used to find your project in Todoist. This string has to appear at the beginning of the project's name. default_reminder : if this is set to true and there is a time associated with the event in the file then that will be added as a default reminder timezone : the name of the timezone to use for events in the file. Defaults to UTC. todoist_api_key : you can provide the Todoist api key here. This is useful if you have different Todoist accounts, and you want to use them in separate configurations. only_future_events : if this is set to true then only those events will be submitted to Todoist that have a date in the future. Reminder times You can use as many [[reminder_times]] sections as you like to customize the reminder time for your events. Each [[reminder_times]] can contain any combination of the following values (these should be integer values): hour : the absolute hour component of the reminder time in the configured time zone. If your timezone is set to Europe/Berlin and you set this value to 6 then you will get a reminder at 6:00AM Berlin time. minute : the absolute minute component of the reminder time. second : the absolute second component of the reminder time. day_offset : the relative day component of the reminder time. If you set this to -1 then you will get a reminder 1 day before the event time. hour_offset : the relative hour component of the reminder time. If you set this to -1 then you will get a reminder 1 hour before the event time. minute_offset : the relative minute component of the reminder time.
