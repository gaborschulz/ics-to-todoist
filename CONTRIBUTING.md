3. Update the documentation.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same

Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
Here are two great examples:

- [http://www.openradar.me/11905408](http://www.openradar.me/11905408)

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports, not even kidding.
